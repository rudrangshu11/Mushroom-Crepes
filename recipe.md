1. Prepare the batter for the crepes: mix the eggs with the flour, then dilute the batter with the milk (1). *If there are some lumps, you can either pass the batter to the blender or through a colander*

2. Lightly grease a pan with a paper towel, pour a ladle of batter and distribute it evenly in the pan. When it is firmed on one side and it begins to detach from the walls, turn it over and cook on the other side. Continue until you finish the batter

3. In the meantime, heat the oil with the garlic. Peel and clean the mushrooms if you use them fresh, then cut them into pieces and throw them in a pan. *If instead you use them frozen, defrost over medium heat in another pan and then cut those that seem particularly large.*

4. Cook until they are soft and the liquid they release will be almost completely dried. Add salt. *Optional: Pepper and Parsley*

5. Prepare the bechamel. Melt the butter, add the flour and bring to the heat to dry the roux. Add the milk, thicken on the fire, then season with salt.

6. Stuff the crêpes with the mushrooms, put them in a pan and sprinkle them with bechamel. Bake at 180° C for about 15 minutes, until your crêpes are light brown in color. Serve them hot.
